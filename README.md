# Introducing My Parking Jam Project: Bus Station Edition
I've developed a prototype for a logic puzzle game inspired by the classic "Parking Jam" concept, but with a unique twist: it's all about bus traffic and passenger management.

Built using Python for the core logic and PyQt6 for the graphical user interface, the game challenges players to navigate the complexities of a bustling bus station. The primary goal is to simulate and optimize the boarding of passengers onto available buses, which are initially "jammed" within the station's traffic flow.

# Gameplay & Features
Imagine a chaotic bus station where vehicles are gridlocked. Your objective is to strategically move buses to clear pathways, allowing "available" buses to reach the designated boarding platforms. Once a bus arrives at a platform, eager passengers waiting can finally board. It's a dynamic puzzle that demands careful planning and foresight to ensure a continuous flow of both people and public transport.
To enhance the player experience, I've implemented several key features:
- Auto-Play: Watch the game solve itself or get insights into optimal moves.
- Suggestion: Need a hint? Get a suggestion for the next best move.
- Restart: Quickly reset the current puzzle and try a new approach.
- Exit Game: Easily quit the application.

# Winning Condition
The player wins the game only when all waiting passengers have successfully boarded the available buses in their designated lines. This requires not just freeing up buses, but also ensuring the efficient flow of people to their correct transport.
