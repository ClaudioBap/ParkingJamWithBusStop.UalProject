# Introducing My Parking Jam Project: Bus Station Edition
I've developed a prototype for a logic puzzle game inspired by the classic "Parking Jam" concept, but with a unique twist: it's all about bus traffic and passenger management.

Built using Python for the core logic and PyQt6 for the graphical user interface, the game challenges players to navigate the complexities of a bustling bus station. The primary goal is to simulate and optimize the boarding of passengers onto available buses, which are initially "jammed" within the station's traffic flow.

How the Game Works:
Imagine a chaotic bus station where vehicles are gridlocked. Your objective is to strategically move buses to clear pathways, allowing "available" buses to reach the designated boarding platforms. Once a bus arrives at a platform, eager passengers waiting can finally board. It's a dynamic puzzle that demands careful planning and foresight to ensure a continuous flow of both people and public transport.

I implemented functions like auto-Play, Sugestion, Restart and exit Game as you see in the image above.
